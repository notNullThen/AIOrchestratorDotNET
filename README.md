# AI Orchestrator

This project implements AI Orchestration, using one AI model as an "orchestrator" to manage other AI models.

It is built to be universal for various tasks assigned to each model.

The goal is to achieve easy management of the complex logic or systems of AI models and their interactions.

## Features

- **Context Handling:** Relies on it's own chat history management for context understanding.
- **Parquet File Support:** Reads Parquet datasets and transfers them as strings for AI consumption.
- **Expandable for AI Orchestration:** Project is under development to incorporate AI orchestration capabilities.
- **AI:** Designed as a universal solution to work with different AI models. Currently functional with Ollama.

## Requirements

- .NET Framework
- Ollama API accessible at `http://localhost:11434`

## How to Use

1. Set up Ollama API.
2. Run the project.
3. Interact with the chat system and explore Parquet dataset integration.
